//Scenario
//The Little Lemon app allows users to view and interact with Little Lemonâ€™s menu. As you now know, to make this functionality possible, the menu data needs to be fetched from the server first.
//In this exercise, you will use URLSession and URLSessionDataTask to perform the HTTP requests and receive the menu data from the server.

//Step 1: Define the Little Lemon server address as a constant String

import Foundation
let littleLemonAddress = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Meta-Mobile-Developer-PC/Working-With-Data-API/main/littleLemonSimpleMenu.json"

//Step 2: Initialize a new URL object with the Little Lemon address String

let url = URL(string: littleLemonAddress)

//Step 3: Use guard to unwrap the Optional url constant

guard let url = url else { throw NSError() }

//Step 4: Create a new URLRequest object with unwrapped url
let request = URLRequest(url:url)

//Step 5: Create a new URLSessionDataTask using request constant
let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
    
    //Step 6: Resume the task to execute it
    //task.resume()
    
    //Step 7: Handle the response data of the data task
    
    if let data = data,
       
        //Step 8: Convert the Data to String
       let string = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
        
        //Print the response String to the console
        print(string)
    }
}
task.resume()
